# Example of Node.js Request-Response
This is an example of a basic Node.js HTTP server that demonstrates the concept of request-response interaction.

## Prerequisites
Before using this server, just make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official website:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
``` bash
cd RequestResponse
```
3. Start the server on one terminal.
``` bash
node index.js
```
4. Open another terminal and curl the server.
``` bash
curl localhost:3000
```
5. That's it! You should see the response from the server. ðŸ˜Š
